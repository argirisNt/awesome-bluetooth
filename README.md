This is a bluetooth manager (with tray icon) for the awesome window manager.

It allows you to
- connect and disconnect bluetooth devices
- view the current connection state of all paired devices
- get a notification box when a device connects or disconnects


It can not pair new devices - that needs to be done using bluetoothctl.

You will need https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lua-ldbus/ to be installed.
